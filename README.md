# EldenLord-Robot-Code
Codes for the robot called "Elden Lord" built in 2022 Spring Term PHY_261_A Research Experience class. 

* elden-lord-v0.0.4.v5python is the final version of the code. It still have many issues.
* The robot should be able to grab things and move around, and there's a very weakly coded auto-aim function which has many limitations.
